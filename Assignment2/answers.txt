Microkernel's user services and kernel services are impletemented under different address space unlike Monolithic Kernel.
Microkernel is smaller in size in compensate with slower execution while being easily extendible. Single crash on a service would not affect other services as well as kernel.
Monolithic Kernel is bigger but faster, while maintaining a less extendable form.

"Everything is a file" means everything in the OS is represented by a file descriptor. All the things including files, directories, pipes are abstracted by the filesystem.

A file descriptor is like an entry number to opened file. Essentially they are unsigned integer nuhmbers used by a process to identify the opened file.
Yes. The value of 2 is possible, since the system will assign positive unsigned integers when the file is opened correctly.
